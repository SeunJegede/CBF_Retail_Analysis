**UK High Street Business Analysis Proposal**

**Scenario**: A UK high‑street retailer wants to improve customer retention and improve marketing efficiency. To do this, the business needs a better understanding of which customers deliver the most value and how it's different across regions. 

**Proposal Outline**:

**Goal**: Identify high‑value customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modelling and uncover patterns of retention per region to support targeted marketing and customer‑health reporting.

**Data**: Public ecommerce datasets such as thelook_ecommerce. Containing primarily order, product, customer and order items tables.

**Methodology**: Using Visual Studio Code and PostgreSQL to join orders and product data. Calculate RFM scores for each customer to segment them into value tiers. Analyse retention trends across UK regions

**Outcome**: A ranked list of high‑value customers based on RFM scoring. Clear insight into which regions show the strongest retention and which require intervention. A dashboard that monitors customer health, identifies churn risks, and guides targeted marketing strategies.

**Ethics**: Use only publicly available or synthetic datasets to avoid exposing real customer information. Maintain transparency in modelling decisions to prevent biased customer segmentation.
